					<h1>Brief</h1>
<p> The aim of this project is to simplify and organise phone orders for a pizza company </p>

				<p>To start this project, I made a plan of what I needed, this includes but was not limited to
				pizza price, lists and quiting the program. For this I also made a project backlog, this has all
				the information stored in one place, from this I will make multiple sprints approximity one for each
				idea. The focus of this method of structuring, is to break a large project into small manageble chunks
				these are sprints, for this project these sprints will be about one to two lessons. </p>

<p>This code above prints out the list when the user presses r and then also can quit the loop by pressing q,
	if they enter any other option a validation error. The aim of this code is establish the list, this list has
three variables, one for price, another for name and the third for amount of pizzas. The quit is to exit the loop and prints
a helpful message indicating this. The review option shows the list formatted for easier use. The list here only has
three variables, this makes the code at the moment easier to follow. Latter I will expand this lists to 10 options.  </p>

	<p>This version is currently functional and works just as expected, the validation despite being smaller works well
	and means the code will not automatically crash. The plan for the next version is to add an amount to the pizzas,
	to do this we need to know the indices. </p>

<h2>Photos of the working code</h2
				<p></p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In this version you can now add pizzas, this allows the user to be interactive with the system. To add pizzas you need to know the index number,
	 this is done through a simple code that gets referenced multiple times. The one issue I had here was accessing my files,
 this was easily fixed through some re-organisation. This code is controlled by the indexes, the user enters which indices they
	 want to access, then adds the amount to the list.
</p>
	<p>
	 This is all functional, to do this I added some basic validation. The company asked that there would be a max of pizzas
	 per type. If they return more than 5 pizzas the program sends an error message and doesn't add the amount. The next
 level with this validation is to add a different error message if the user enters a string instead of an integer.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In this version you can now subtract pizzas, this allows the user to be interactive with the system. To subtract pizzas you need to know the index number, this is done through a simple code that gets referenced multiple times. This is very similar to the code for the addition of pizzas.
</p>
<p>
However the new feature here is the addition of a print receipt function, this collects the list of the users order, this being the amount and type of pizzas ordered. This then goes to the calculator where the total is calculated. This is all printed in an easy to follow “receipt” format.

</p>
  <p>
   This is all functional, to do this I added some basic validation. The user can only subtract up to the amount of pizzas they have ordered. This means there are no negative values of pizzas as this could run into issues further down the tract. Because there are now two functions that require validation, I have created a function for this, it collects the maximum and minimum number of pizzas to be added or subtracted and the message/ouput you would like the user to see.

</pre>

<p>For this version I worked on creating a delivery option that allowed the user to choose either takeaway at no extra cost or delivery at a cost of three dollars. Both these options need more information about the user including but not limited to phone number, address and name. </p>

<p>The name and address of the user was easy to validate with string validation. The hard part was the phone number for this I had two trial options, these had feature the same and different</p>

<p> Trial 1
This trial was very simple and involved validating the length of the phone number with a len function. This ment the phone number had to be between 8 and 12 digits long as this was the minimum and maximum length a regional phone number could be according to Google. There was a few errors when testing this code including that if the phone number started with a 0, the code would drop it, because it was looking for the simplest form of the “number”. This could lead to many problems in the future.</p>

<p> Trial 2
This trial was one including regex, that needed to be imported. This is shown by the import re code at the top of the page. This imports a package from python that does not need to be downloaded.

The function I wanted to run this code through was this:
(^\([0][3]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][4]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][6]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][7]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][9]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][2][1]\))(\d{6,8}$)|(^\([0][2][2]\))(\d{6,8}$)|(^\([0][2][7]\))(\d{6,8}$)|(^\([0][2][9]\))(\d{6,8}$)|([0][8][0][0])([\s])(\d{5,8}$)


This looks very confusing however it all makes sense, to start with I wanted to work  out what type of phone numbers people could have and I ended up with this list for New Zealand.

<h2> Landline phone numbers with area codes </h2>
<ul class="list-inline">
	<li>03</li>
<li>04</li>
<li>06</li>
<li>07</li>
<li>09</li>
</ul>

<h2> Mobile phone numbers with the suffix </h2>
<ul class="list-inline">
	<li>021</li>
<li>022</li>
<li>027</li>
<li>029</li>
</ul>

<p>The final phone number I wanted to include was an 0800 number as theses as also used around NZ</p>

<p> The (^\([0][2][1]\))(\d{6,8}$)|(^\([0][2][2]\))(\d{6,8}$)|(^\([0][2][7]\))(\d{6,8}$)|(^\([0][2][9]\))(\d{6,8}$)|
 part of this code is for the mobile numbers. I would like the user to enter the prefix to the number in the brackets. This allows the user to enter any prefix beginning with 02 followed by a number that is either 1,2,7 or 9. The rest of the phone number must then be between 6 and 8 digits long as this is what the length should be between. THe format should be (021)flowed by the 6-8 digit number. </p>

<p> The ([0][8][0][0])([\s])(\d{5,8}$) part of this code is for the 0800 numbers as you can see this is not in brackets. The number then must have between 5 and 8 additional digits. </p>

<p> The (^\([0][3]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][4]))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][7]\))(\d{7}$)|(^\([0][9]\))(\d{7}$)
 part of the code above is for the landline numbers, this requires that the prefix 0 then either 3,4,6,7 or 9 be in a bracket followed by 7 digits. </p>


<p> By using this code I learnt a lot about regex and how it works, which allowed me to make this code, this became function through using a if statement with a search function that returned an error if none of these condition where meet

<p>After a lot of reach I decided that option two was  viable for the project I was doing. This is because it would accept the number for having the leading zero and provide a more in depth understanding of the code and what errors the number could have. To fully implement this from a trial basis I would need to fully explain to the user what format their answer needed to be in.</p>
